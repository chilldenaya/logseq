- the frame representation seen there focused more on the organization
  and invocation of procedures than on inferences about the objects and
  categories themselves.

- Reasoning about objects in everyday thinking
  goes well beyond the simple cascaded computations seen in that chapter,
  and is based on considerations like the following:
	- objects are very often thought of as being members of
	  multiple categories (e.g., I am an author, an employee, and a father);
	- objects have parts, sometimes in multiples (e.g., books have titles,
	  tables have legs, automobiles have wheels);
-
- compound predicate
	- Hunter&Gatherer(x),
		- both Hunter(x) and Gatherer(x) would also be true
	- In a description logic, we refer to the frame type of
	  description as a concept and to the slot as a role.
